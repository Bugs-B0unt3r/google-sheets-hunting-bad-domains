# google-sheets-hunting-bad-domains
This project provides a set of Google Apps Scripts designed to help you identify and analyze potentially malicious domains directly from Google Sheets. By leveraging various APIs, these scripts can retrieve information such as VirusTotal reports, WHOIS data, breach information from Have I Been Pwned, and the HTTP status of a domain.
